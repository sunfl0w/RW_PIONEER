# RW-Pioneer

RW-Pioneer is a computer project inspired by Ben Eater's [8-bit breadboard computer project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) over at YouTube.
I always wanted to build my own crappy computer, and the Pioneer was my first such attempt.
The design is not perfect by any means, but it was the best one I could come up with after a few semesters of studying computer science.

**Note that the RW-Pioneer is a few years old by now and I only compiled old schematics, layouts and code for this repository.**

## Content

This repository contains the following schematics and software components:

- RW-Pioneer schematics, paper explaining the architecture and KiCad design files (Computer system)
- HEX-Module schematics and KiCad design files (Hexedecimal display expansion module)
- 1602-Module schematics and KiCad design files (1602-LCD expansions module)
- Memory-Programmer schematics and KiCad design files (Memory programmer to program the computer)
- Memory-Programmer host and programmer software sources (Software to run the memory programmer)

## Licenses

The software and schematics are licensed under the permissive BSD 3-Clause License.
